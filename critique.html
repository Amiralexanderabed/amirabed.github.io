        The website/article I will be critiquing is called, “What is the Best Engineering Degree?”
        </p1>

            This website is attempting to answer the question, “What really is the best engineering major?” 
            The website ranks Petroleum engineering as the best engineering degree, but it does so because petroleum engineers make the most money out of all the engineering majors. The second best engineering major according to this website is biomedical engineering, which makes the second most on this list. However, I quickly realized that this list only has five engineering majors, and wondered why it does not include the many other types of engineering degrees. Other important engineering degrees such as electrical, mechanical, and aerospace are some of the best engineering majors not only because of their prominence in academics at universities, but also because of their substantial influence in the world in anything from cell phones to cars to planes. For this reason, I disagree with the author’s view on what the best engineering majors are.

            Though I disagree with the author’s claim, the website itself is very credible. It has reference links for other engineering majors on its web page and it also has top engineering universities for engineering degrees it lists on the web page as well. The domain name is .org so it is a non-profit website, and is therefore most likely a scholarly work.
